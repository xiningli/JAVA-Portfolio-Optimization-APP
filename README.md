    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the PSTAT 234 final project report of our group. The topic of this report is portfolio optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio optimization has wide application in financial industry. To make investment in a group of assets, investors need to construct a portfolio that determines how much money we should allocate to each asset. Generally, investors are risk-inverse -- they pursue high portfolio return while avoid uncertainty of return (i.e. risk). This leads to the primary objective of portfolio optimization: how to maximize the portfolio return at a given level of risk, or how to minimize portfolio risk at a given level of portfolio return. In Markovitz mean-variance portfolio model [1], risk is measured by the standard deviation of portfolio returns, and the optimal portfolio allocation is totally determined by the true return of each asset and the covariance matrix of the returns of the group of assets. However, in practice, the true returns and covariance matrix are not observable, they can only be estimated from asset historical data.\n",
    " \n",
    "There are many ways to estimate the covariance matrix of returns of a group of assets. In this report, we will compare 3 estimation methods for the true covariance matrix or its inverse. As a result, we need to consider the minimal variance portfolio (MVP) model [2], instead of the mean-variance portfolio model. The former pursues to minimize portfolio risk regardless of the portfolio return and only requires to estimate the covariance matrix. It provides a better setting to compare the effectiveness of different (inverse) covariance matrix estimations. One problem of using historical data to estimate (inverse) covariance matrix is that because the financial market is not stationary, it needs to re-computed periodically (called rebalancing). This report will compare different rebalancing frequencies for each estimation method.\n",

    "Suppose that we invest among $p$ assets. Let $r_{ti}$ is the daily return of $i$-th asset at time $t$, and $r_t = (r_{t1}, r_{t2}, \\cdots, r_{tp})^T$ be the daily return vector of all assets at time $t$.

However, because returns are not stationary over time, the estimated covariance of returns must be periodically updated. A general way is to periodically re-calculate $\\hat{\\Sigma}$ and rebalance the portfolio. Suppose that portfolio rebalancing period is $L$, meaning that every $L$ days the portfolio will be rebalanced once. Let $T_0$ be the investment starting time, and $T_E$ be the end time.

    "- **Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage estimator**: The problem of using sample covariance matrix estimation is that in high dimensional case where $L\\leq p$, $S$ is singular and not invertible. Also, it has been shown [5] that sample covariance matrix contains large estimation error that could distort the portfolio optimization.  Many regularization methods have been proposed to estimate (inverse) covariance matrix. For example, the Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage estimator\n",
